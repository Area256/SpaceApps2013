This is not a unified system yet, instead, there are many small pieces that are used.

The following steps are to be used:
1. Segment images to remove earth, filter to get brightest stars, and generate star-trail images from the results
2. Extract length of star-trails
3. Calculate direction of camera from the length of the star-trails
4. Segment original image in order to get the aurora
5. Calculate where on earth the aurora is above
6. Show the aurora in Stellarium

Two different segmentation methods were tried:
kmeans
level sets (jeff orchard)

kmeans seemed to work better (took less time and still gave us what we needed).
