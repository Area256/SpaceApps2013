This is not a unified system yet, instead, there are many small pieces that are used.

The following steps are to be used:
1. Segment images to remove earth, filter to get brightest stars, and generate star-trail images from the results
2. Extract length of star-trails
3. Calculate direction of camera from the length of the star-trails
4. Segment original image using level sets (level set implementation done by Jeff Orachard), in order to get the aurora
5. Calculate where on earth the aurora is above
6. Show the aurora in Stellarium
